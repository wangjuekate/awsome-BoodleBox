# awsome-BoodleBox
Open, teaching-ready API and “bootlebox” templates for learning, experimentation, and applied systems education.

## 🎓 Open API & Bootlebox Templates for Educators

This repository is a **community-driven collection of API templates, bootlebox setups, and system scaffolds** designed for **teaching, learning, and applied experimentation**.

The goal is to lower the cost of going from *concept → runnable system* in classrooms, workshops, and independent study.

### What this repo is for
- Educators building **hands-on assignments** involving APIs, AI, data, or platforms
- Students learning how **real systems are wired together**
- Researchers prototyping tools for experiments or simulations
- Practitioners who want clean, minimal reference implementations

### What you’ll find here
- 📦 **Bootlebox templates** (self-contained, remixable system setups)
- 🔌 **API scaffolds** (auth, logging, orchestration, data flows)
- 🧪 **Teaching-ready examples** with clear boundaries and assumptions
- 📝 **Instructor notes** explaining design tradeoffs and extensions

### Design principles
- **Pedagogy first** – clarity beats cleverness
- **Composable systems** – swap components without rewrites
- **Minimal dependencies** – easy to run locally or in the cloud
- **Open by default** – permissive licenses, remix encouraged

### What this is *not*
- Not a production SaaS
- Not a no-code tool
- Not tied to any single vendor or model

### How to contribute
- Add new templates
- Improve documentation
- Share classroom use cases
- Report confusing abstractions

## 🤝 Teaching, Research & Collaboration

This project is maintained by an educator-led team focused on **hands-on systems learning**.

If you are:
- Using these templates in a **course or workshop**
- Interested in **customizing** them for a specific teaching context
- Exploring **research, simulation, or applied AI** collaborations
- Looking for **institutional support** (hosting, setup, or training)

You’re welcome to reach out.

📬 **Contact the founding team**
